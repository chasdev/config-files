## Shared Configuration Files

I create sym links to the files in this repo so I can easily share configuration across my computers. 

These files assume:

1. The Janus distribution for Vim. 
1. Tmux
1. Git
1. Exuberant Tags (ctags)
1. Kaleidoscope

On OS X I use: 
* brew to install ctags and tmux (and much more). 
* gvm to manage groovy, grails, and gradle installations
* Kaleidoscope as the diff and merge tool
* Sublime Text 2 (occasional, I use tmux/vim primarily)
* Iterm2 with Solarized
* Node.js, npm, Ruby, rvm,
