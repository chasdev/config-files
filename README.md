## Shared Configuration Files

I currently use sym links to the following files in this repo to share configuration across computers. 

```
.bash_profile, .gitconfig, .tmux.conf, and .vimrc
```

My Mac setup is outlined in [Mac_setup_for_development](./Mac_setup_for_development.md).

_Note that previously I used the janus distribution of vim, and sym linked .vimrc.before and .vimrc.after. 
These two files will be removed shortly._
