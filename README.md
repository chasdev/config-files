## Shared Configuration Files

I create sym links to the files in this repo so I can easily share configuration across my computers. 

These files currently assume OS X with the following:

* The Janus distribution for Vim. 
* iterm2
* Tmux
* Git
* Exuberant Tags (ctags)
* Kaleidoscope

(TODO: Support Ubuntu configuration within same files.)

Other information about my own OS X environment: 
* brew is used to install ctags and tmux (and much more). 
* gvm is used to manage groovy, grails, and gradle installations
* Kaleidoscope (commercial product) is used as the diff and merge tool
* Sublime Text 2 (occasional use of this commercial product, I use tmux/vim primarily)
* Iterm2 with Solarized
* Node.js, npm, Ruby, rvm
