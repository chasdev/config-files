## Shared Configuration Files

I use sym links to the following files in this repo to share configuration across computers. 

```
.bash_profile, .gitconfig, .tmux.conf, .vimrc.after, .vimrc.before
```

There are some dependencies on OS X and the applications I use, pertaining to the following:

* The [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) distribution for Vim 
* iterm2
* Tmux
* Git
* Exuberant Tags (ctags) is used to index Groovy files
* Kaleidoscope (commercial product) is used as the diff and merge tool
* gvm is used to manage groovy, grails, and gradle installations
* rvm is used to manage ruby installations

(TODO:  Extract OS X specific settings and configure settings for Ubuntu VMs)

Other information about my own OS X environment: 

* brew is used to install ctags and tmux (and much more). 
* Sublime Text 2 (occasional use of this commercial product, I use tmux/vim primarily)
* Solarized (used for both iTerm and vim)
* Node.js, npm, Ruby
