## Shared Configuration Files

This repo is used to manage configuration 'dot files' that I share across my computers. I make no claims this configuration is better than others etc., it simply is what I use.  I sym link the various dot files on each of my computers to use files from a local clone of this repository.

My Mac setup is outlined in [Mac_setup_for_development](./Mac_setup_for_development.md).

NOTE: The zsh-vim-tmux parts of the development environment supported by this repository is dockerized (the Dockerfile and instructions are contained in the [chasdev/dev-env](https://github.com/chasdev/dev-env) GitHub repo.

_As this repository is intended to hold my own configuration, I make no guarantees whatsoever. If you do use this configuration, please send a pull request if you have fixes or improvements, thanks._
