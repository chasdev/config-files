## Shared Configuration Files

This repo is used to manage my configuration 'dot files' that I share across my computers. I make no claims this configuration is better than others etc., it simply is what I use.  I sym link the various dot files on each of my computers to use files from a local clone of this repository.   

My Mac setup is outlined in [Mac_setup_for_development](./Mac_setup_for_development.md).

NOTE: The zsh - vim - tmux development environment supported by this repository can be dockerized. Although I am still refining this, a Dockerfile (and supporting Vagrantfile) is available here: [https://github.com/chasdev/dev-env](https://github.com/chasdev/dev-env).

As this repository is intended to hold my own configuration, I make no guarantees whatsoever. If you do use this configuration, please send a pull request if you have fixes or improvements, thanks.
